# MY HELPERS

This folder has the necessary files to implement the tracker objects. Most of my hours are spent to create this folder, either coding or reading books and papers (most of them at least 25 years old)

## common
This one suppose to be the common helper file for the other helper files. It turns out that they do not share much. It has only 3 functions

## findCovariance

Main purpose is to find the covariance of the trackers when they are initialized. Do not worry this script is only run once and the results are hard coded to the tracker class files. I have added the necessary explanation to my intern report, you can read from there to see what it does.

## immHelper

It is for IMM

## jpdaHelper

It is for JPDA

## pdaHelper

It is for PDA

## unscentedHelper

It is for UKF

## visualizeHelper

Has the necessary function to visualize the multiple target results and play them.

## playGround

It is a place where I have tested my implementations, you can ignore it.
